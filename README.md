Overview
Indus OS is an app store company founded in 2013 by 3 IITians, including Rakesh Deshmukh, Akash Dongre, and Sudhir B, and backed by PhonePe. It is building India’s largest Android app store — called Indus App Bazaar — that benefits over 200 million Indian users by delivering mobile apps to them in their own language and acts as a gateway for local app developers to distribute and grow their apps freely and fairly.

Indus App Bazaar, a 'Made in India' Android app store, serves  Indian users by offering highly personalised and localised apps. Indus App Bazaar also benefits developers by helping them in distributing their apps with zero charges.

Mission: To bridge the gap between mobile apps and their benefactors, i.e. users, developers, and OEMs. We are building an Indian app store that will offer the most relevant app recommendations to users in their preferred Indian language while helping developers grow and monetise their apps with maximum support and no restrictions.

Vision: To become India's largest third-party app store for users and app developers.
